This is the repository for 
Machine Learning for Parenting: Using Supervised Machine Learning to Predict RIFL Scores Using Text and Audio Mediums 
by Christopher Mountain, supervised by Professor Eldan Cohen.

The data_processing_and_feature_engineering folder contains data reformatting code for the data as it was given to me
by researchers at OISE. The processing scripts are designed to be run on this data to get it into a usable format.
The feature_embedding scripts can be run to construct the features from the formatted data so that they become npz files
containing features and labels.

The models each load in an npz file, and then proceed train and execute a model. Please be conscious of the type of data
you are loading in; for example, the GRU, Transformer, and ROCKET will require sequential feature data as generated in 
audio_feature_embedding.ipynb or in the second part of text_feature_embedding.ipynb. Other models take singular features
for each sample. These models are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, XGB_Classifier, XGB_Ranker, and XGBandSVR.

By convention, anywhere we load in feature set, "X-y.npz" is set as a placeholder. Change this to the actual feature set you are using.
